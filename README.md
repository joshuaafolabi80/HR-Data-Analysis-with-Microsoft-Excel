## Introduction
This README provides a brief overview and guidance on how to perform HR data analytics using Microsoft Excel. Human Resources (HR) data analytics is a valuable practice that helps organizations make informed decisions related to their workforce, recruitment, retention, and performance management. In this guide, we will cover the essential steps to analyze HR data using Microsoft Excel, including data preparation, analysis, and visualization.

## Getting Started
Before you begin with HR data analytics, make sure you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Excel's functions and features.

## Dataset
The dataset employed for this analysis originates from Google documents. [The dataset is available at] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/...) The dataset encompasses the following key elements: Total employee, Total attrition, Average age, Active employee, Attrition rate, Job satisfaction rating, Gender and sum of employee count, Job Role, Department, Age Group, Marital Status, etc

## Data Preparation
1. Data Collection
Gather HR-related data such as employee records, performance metrics, and other relevant information. Ensure your data is accurate, up-to-date, and well-structured.

Identify and remove duplicate or irrelevant entries. Address missing data by filling in or removing incomplete records. Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, names, job titles).
3. Data Organization
Create an Excel spreadsheet and name it appropriately. Organize your data into columns, with each column representing a specific variable (e.g., Employee ID, : Total employee, Department).

## Descriptive Analytics
